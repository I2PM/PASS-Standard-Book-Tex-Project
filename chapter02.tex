\chapter{The Structure of a PASS Process Models}
\label{PASSStruct}

This chapter, contains specification of the graphical, subject-oriented process modeling language Parallel Activity Specification Schema (PASS). First in an informal manner intended for introduction of terms and concepts of PASS. And in the later section introduces the formal definition of an digital exchange standard of PASS models based on the semantic-web technologies that are the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). 

%Note: Standard PASS

\section{Principle Structure}

In contrast to classic process description means, PASS process models do not consist of a single diagram graph but may consist of multiple diagrams of principle two types that together form the process model.

Each model consist of a \textbf{Subject Interaction Diagram (SID)} that defines the \textit{Subjects} in a process or process system and their principle interaction means in the form of messages.

The second diagram type of PASS are the \textbf{Subject Behavior Diagrams (SBD)} that should exist at least once for every fully specified standard subject in an SID. Next to main or \textit{base behavior} diagram, a subject may be associated with other, specialized behavior diagrams.

There is a one-to-many (1:n) relationship between SID and \textit{its} SBDs. In a coherent PASS model, the content of the SBDs must follow the specifications of the SID.

Both diagram types use a heterogeneous set of symbols!

The principle idea and elements of both diagrams are described in the following sections.
