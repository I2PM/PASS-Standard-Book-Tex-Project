\chapter{Various Aspects for further Standardisation Activities}

\todo{CS: Hochkommas und - im pdf falsch gedruckt.}

In this chapter is a loose collection of various aspects of relevance for the paradigm of subject-oriented for process modelling and programming.  These aspects have been published as different conferences contributions. The following sections are based on these publications. \todo{CS:They contain original text parts and thus, the conclusions need to be aligned to the standardization effort, as tried for Fog Computing.}
The concepts described in theses sections will be part of future standardisation activities. For now, the following sections are not aligned and should be considered as the independent works that they are. 

The following sections are based on following publications:\\
\begin{list}{-}
	\item Subjects and Shared Input Pools: \cite{article:SharedInputPool}
	\item Subject-Phase Model based process specifications \cite{article:SubjectPhase}
	\item Hierarchies in Communication Oriented Business Process Models: \cite{article:Subject-hierarchies}
	\item Business Activity Monitoring for S-BPM: \cite{article:SubProcessMon}
	\item Subject Oriented Project Management: \cite{article:Subject-Oriented-Project-Management}
	\item Subject-oriented Fog Computing: \cite{article:FogComp}
	\item Activity based Costing \cite{article:SBPMCosting}
\end{list}
